v3 was designed during the 1st Kickstarter campaign.

This version is 5V only, with 2 USB connectors.

The through hole manufacturing costs of the v2 full wave bridge 
part was troubling. So I made the bridge surface mount only by 
changing to 4 SMD schottky diodes. 

I also added a 26 V TVS diode to clip off any peaks in the input 
that get too close to the chip's 30 Volt absolute max rating.
