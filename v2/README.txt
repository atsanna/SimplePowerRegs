v2:
This is a one board, two products design with both 5 Volt and 
adjustable voltage output, up to 5 Amps. Only a few parts are 
different between the two models.

Some manufacturers put a diode across the input and call it 
"polarity protection". This is a cheap solution that creates 
a short circuit and could cause damage to the upstream equipment 
driving it. 

I added a full wave bridge, so it can take DC input wired either 
way and AC input as well, what I'm calling universal polarity. 

The 5 Volt version has the USB Direct Charging Port feature
allowing devices to consume up to 1.5 Amps of charging current.

The adjustable output model leaves off the USB connector and has 
a 5 turn trimpot to adjust the output voltage. The range is about
1.2V to 15V, but the linear trimpot takes nearly a whole turn to 
go from 1.2 to 1.4V and only a few degrees between 14V and 15V.
