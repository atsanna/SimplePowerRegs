v4:
v4 was designed immediately before the 2nd Kickstarter campaign.

This version is also fixed 5V with 2 USB charge ports. 

During the 1st campaign I was including a 5.5mm/2.1mm barrel connector 
with each board. v4 has it built-in.

The physical size of the board kept jumping around in the 1.7 to 1.9
inch range. Settling on a fixed size simplifies testing, and my friends 
at DemandPeripherals.com have a nice 1.875" square layout that is very 
similar. So now I have compatible mounting fixtures, etc.

While the outside 1.875 inch dimension sounds anything but metric, the
mounting holes are 40 mm in both directions. The holes are 1/8 inch, 
and suitable for either 4-40 or M3 screws.
