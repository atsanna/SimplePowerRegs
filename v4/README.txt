v4:
v4 was designed immediately before the 2nd Kickstarter campaign.

This version has both the 5V & adjustable two models for one board,
and 2 USB ports on the 5V version. 

During the 1st campaign I was including a 5.5mm/2.1mm barrel connector 
with each board. v4 has it built-in.

The physical size of the board kept jumping around in the 1.7 to 1.9
inch range. Settling on a fixed size simplifies testing, and my friends 
at DemandPeripherals.com have a nice 1.875" square layout that is very 
similar. So now I have compatible mounting fixtures, etc.
