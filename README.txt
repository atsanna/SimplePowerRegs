This is the Simple Power series of switching regulators,
and its Open Source Hardware OSHW documentation.

v1,v2,v3,v4 are designs of 4 separate boards.
They were designed in a sequence, improving along the way,
but also changing configuration as well, so they are not 
simply versions of the same board. Probably no one would want
to make a v2 or v3, since v4 builds on both of them, but v1 
is still quite useful for smaller loads.
