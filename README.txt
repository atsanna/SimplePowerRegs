This is the Simple Power series of switching regulators,
and its Open Source Hardware OSHW documentation.

They were designed in this order, making changes and improvements
along the way. pwrlnk.com has a blog with some discussion of the 
design process.


v1 
is 5V 3A output, with up to 30VDC input.
still useful for smaller loads.


v2 
changes the switcher part to 5 Amp output and adds a full-wave 
bridge at the input, up to 7-28VDC or 6-18VAC.

The same board supports two variations with a few parts changes:
1) 5Amp fixed 5VDC output.
2) 5Amp varible 1.2 ~ 15 VDC output.



v3 
is 5V 5A output, with 7-28VDC or 6-18VAC input.



v4 
is a refinement of v3, coming soon to tindie.com
